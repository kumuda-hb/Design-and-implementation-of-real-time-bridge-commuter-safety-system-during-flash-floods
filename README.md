# Design-and-implementation-of-real-time-bridge-commuter-safety-system-during-flash-floods
Floods are basic catastrophic events that allow extreme desolation of any nation. They are typically brought about by precipitation and overflow of waterways, especially during heavy stormy seasons. This project aims to monitor the flood condition and send alerts if there is an occurrence of risk through wi-fi. The measurement of rising water level is done to detect the flood. The system uses multiple sensors such as temperature and humidity sensor, ultrasonic sensor, rain sensor. If the microcontroller detects the flood then the gate will be closed at the entrance to the bridge and e-mail will be sent to the authority. The system instantaneously broadcasts sensor values using wi-fi and these sensor values can be monitored by the authorities.
